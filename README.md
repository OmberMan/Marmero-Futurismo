# Marmero-Futurismo
From the hit game Papers Please: Antegria, if they followed 1910s Italian Futurism instead of whatever. Literally 3 years in the making. Has 1 whole ass country, none of the others. No UU or UB, UA should work. Hmu @recreational-lead-ingester on the Unciv discord if not. Made this on an Android and forces myself out of neurotic burnout to finish it mostly just go finish something so don't expect much. UU and UB should be in by at least 2025.
